## Introduction
The application follows the principles of OOP:
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
SQLite-JDBC Version 3.42.0.1
JavaFX Version 17.0.6
MVC Model and SOLID Principles
By using OOP concepts, the program becomes more organized, maintainable, and extensible. It separates concerns and allows us to focus on specific functionalities within individual classes.


Execution Steps
Assumptions
